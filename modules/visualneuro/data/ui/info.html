        <h2>Group A and B</h2>
        <p>The two subject groups to be compared is specified by using the handles down in the parallel coordinates plot
          to filter out specific groups of subjects. The buttons up on the right labeled "Group A" and "Group B" can be used
          to toggle between the two groups.</p>

      <div class="col-md-5 informationBlock">
        <h2>Atlas</h2>
        <p>The atlas shows the anatomical region of the currently selected coordinate as well as the Broadman area (if any).
        The rendering of the atlas in the 3D view can be turned of with the button in the control panel.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4 informationBlock">
        <h2>T-test comparison</h2>
        <p>The 3D volume in the center shows either the mean of the current subject group, or, if activated, the t-value of the t-test between subject group A and B. The t-test depends on a p-value, which is set in the control
        panel to the right.</p>

      <!--<div class="col-md-7 informationBlock">
        <h2>Topology</h2>
        <p>On the right side of the screen there is a large volume with spheres that shows the topology of the mean volumes
          of the current subject group. The spheres can be clicked to move the 2D slices to a specific point of interest.</p>
        <p>The topology can be filtered with the slider on the right hand side of the screen labeled "Topology datavalue threshold",
          which sets a lower thresholds for which spheres to show.</p>
          <p>The spheres can either be scaled according to their underlying datavalue (from the fMRI mean volume) or their persistence.
            Which scaling method to use can be chosen in the control panel. The overall size of the spheres can also be changed through
            a slider in the control panel.</p>
